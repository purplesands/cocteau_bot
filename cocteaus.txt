 For all other hollow aura|
 And the soul|
 Like hollow days|
 The hollow place|

 So that if I'm last|
 All, Stake, Stuck, Stake|

 Garlands evergreen|
 Forget-me-not wreaths|
 Chaplets see me drugged|
 I could die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Well with these sweet garlands|
 We’ll never find out|
 We’ll never find out|
 Well with these stitches|
 Cravings commence (cravings)|
 My cravings come out (come out)|
 Garlands evergreen|
 Forget-me-not wreaths|
 Chaplets see me drugged|
 I could die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|
 Well with these scarce scars|
 Cravings commence|
 My cravings commence|
 Well with these strange scars|
 I’m more bound to|
 I’m more bound to|
 Garlands evergreen|
 Forget-me-not wreaths|
 Chaplets see me drugged|
 I could die in a rosary|
 Die in a rosary|

 Grail overfloweth|
 There is rain|
 And there is ink and there is love|
 Grail overfloweth|
 There is rain |
 And there is ink and there is love|
 Grail overfloweth|
 There is rain|
 And there’s saliva and there’s you|
 Grail flood on the outside|
 I see|
 It’s not me|
 It’s your whole world|
 You see you|
 It’s me|
 Who sees you|
 Well, I don’t know, I said its name|
 Well, I don’t know, I said it’s you again|
 Grail overfloweth|
 There is me again|
 There is you and me|
 There is me again|
 When I open my eyes|
 There is me again|
 There is rain|

 Sunburst and snowblind|
 I steal the clue and write it down in my book|
 When mama was green and a whitewashed blue|
 Shivers and start screaming to rage in vain|

 When mama was moth, I took bulb form|
 My body electric will writhe in vain|

 He must smell plume-dames by our lane|
 Charge, are we next? He’ll needs go bursting|
 Now do we call while turned my mind|
 Proud mannered|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 For being an old beast seems silly|
 So literally|
 Tell me what I need to do|
 To find you|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 (Fields trust him home … a man has met)|
 He must smell plume-dames by our lane|
 (He’s got time enough for love … a man has made)|
 Charge, are we next? He’ll needs go bursting|
 (Am I really sure I’m alone … well I really don’t know)|
 Now do we call while turned, my mind|
 (So I give the devil’s bone … but there once was doubt)|
 How many?|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 (So I give the devil’s bone where there once was doubt)|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 For being an old crone seems silly|
 So naturally|
 Tell me what I need to do|
 To find you|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 When the king comes off his throne|
 The way that you do, does everyone proud|
 You’re younger than Cow was once, when I’d like to make love|
 When every one of you guys leaves, just hear the word, proud|
 There can’t be no doubt, when I’d love to make love|
 I don’t know (tell the king come off his throne)|
 His troubles start|
 His troubles start (tell the king come off his throne)|
 His troubles start|
 His troubles start (tell the king come off his throne)|

 A secret to be borne|

 That told me of your love|

 Don’t you know the rest of us|
 Will follow some fine day|
 (Grieve your leaving me)|
 Oh I heard you’re leaving please don’t leave me|
 Oh how will I have anything to mourn?|
 Oh how do you think anything you do…|
 Oh bella vita makes no sense at all|
 Are you us all?|
 Try to speak with me|
 My thoughts will be your feelings|
 (And your voice will be my carol)|
 (Grieve your leaving me)|
 (Need your living ghost)|
 Don’t you see my soul|
 Will call me after you|
 (And your voice will be my carol)|
 (Grieve your leaving me)|
 (I need your living ghost)|
 Don’t you know the strength your heart|
 Can pull on from my own|
 (And I grieve you on my own)|
 (Grieve your leaving me)|
 (Another living ghost)|
 Oh I heard you’re leaving please don’t leave me|
 Oh how will I have anything to mourn?|
 Oh how do you think anything you do…|
 Oh bella vita makes no sense at all|
 Are you us all?|

 I don't need my love, please call oh|

 Do call (I’ll keep my heart oh)|
 Nothing at all|
 Oh (nothing)|
 Any day now all the suffering that I knew|
 Will follow through my heart to you|

 Soon I see it wasn’t even he who lives for me|
 Onnena-banana-pila need a day for me|
 Feel the sun feed on me|
 Early morning millionaire|
 Haunting me it fills my face|
 Can I make a magic thing|
 I’ve gone against the greater good so here’s what I still do|
 On-onnenapila Austratila teacup|
 Feel the sun feed on me|
 Early morning millionaire|
 Hiding faces, laundry day|
 The sun is here I need a padlock|
 Ruby is no more|
 Ruby is no one|
 Ruby, your fears now|
 Ruin my life no more|
 How can she stop|
 How can she stop|
 Ruby fears no one|
 Ruby’s glad now|
 What’s the next thing we get done? We learn how to dance|
 Leastly, post a letter and eat salad lettuce|
 Hold the sun, feel my wings|
 Early morning millionaire|
 Really slow, feel my face|
 Nearly make a human now|
 Love is just the little bits of everything I do|
 Hook me on a Chivas Always-tila teacup|
 Hold the sun, feel my wings|
 Early morning millionaire|
 Really dumb but holy power|
 Imagine sounds, sleepy sounds|
 I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (love summer gone ah gone)|
 I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (nearly wobbly nearly wobbly wobble oh)|
 I feel the balance in the solace of the sun and the earth|
 I feel the balance in the solace of the earth|
 I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (nearly wobbly nearly wobbly wobble oh)|
 I feel the solace in the balance of the earth (hope summer gone ah gone)|
 I feel the balance in the solace of the sun and earth|

 It’s time to go to work and he protests, you’ll never leave me|
 Then you’re gonna punt, you’re gonna dig with my pa|
 You can’t go home again and he protests, you’ll never leave me|
 And you’re gonna punt, you’re gonna dig with my pa|
 It’s time to pay the rent and he protests, you’ll never leave me|
 Then you’re gonna punt, you’re gonna dig with my pa|
 My big lug|
 Say, say come off|
 If you don’t be down soon|
~|
 So down, down, down down down|
 Never before, never better|
 Don’t say so, never at all|
 Down, down, oh no|
 Down, down, oh down down down|
 Down, oh, down|
 Down so long, forever and ever|
 Down, down to me|
 Down, down|
 Down, down is|
 Down, for you and me|
 Down, down is our love|
 Far down is our lover|
 Down, down, down there|
 Cause you’re a|
 Bad guy girl|
 Gargamelle|
 Tellurian|
 Can you tell|
 The need I see|
 When I doubt|
 The cure he had|
 Don’t you know that|
 Jesus knows|
 Who’s he inside|
 Bats are his guide|
 Know that they want|
 Easy girls|
 That’s what she’s called|
 I will send them|
 Flecks of love|
 Let Florrie know|
 Let go … my god|
 Don’t tell us how you are lost to|
 What he does without your love|
 How he felt, never before|
 Never love|
 That’s true|
 He’s the better and the weaker one|
 Oh, so lost|
 He’ll be yours soon after this|

 He’s got a lot of love|
 Till I address, dress this mess|
 Some people see him and me, tell us|
 It is wrong to make love on my feet|
 Even then they don’t know how to love|
 (Shack up, try to love, to love this dirty mess)|
 Even then they won’t talk about|
 (Talk about this dirt, dirty mess)|
 (Talk about oh, this dirty, this dirty mess)|
 He’s caught a lot of us|
 Suffused, they brought|
 This side of love, it is to me|
 We may love your hollow head|
 Please|
 Listen to me, you know|
 It’s very low (listen to me)|
 (He’s dropped, he’s got a hollow head)|
 Listen to me|
 It’s very low (listen to me)|
 (He’s dropped, he’s got a hollow head)|
 (Love, it is)|
 (Hollow)|
 (Beautiful)|
 (Hollow)|
 (Dropped through)|
 Sincere heart|
 Yes, it’s the drop of blood|
 Repeat, he has the wish I could drop my name|
 Repeat, he dreams of a doll home|
 If you bend them then they don’t know|
 (Blame me, it’s my attitude)|
 Shack up, shack up, love (my love)|
 (I tell my friends)|
 Believe it, everyone dares say|
 (Blame me, it’s my attitude)|
 Shack up, shack up, love (my love)|
 (I tell my friends)|
 It’s the same thing to me with a car (listen to me)|
 (Blame me, it’s my attitude)|
 So beautiful (my love)|
 (I tell my friends)|
 Listen to me with you (my love)|
 (Blame me, it’s my attitude)|
 It’s very low (my love)|

 Hold your answer, be right out|
 And maybe|
 At a good time|
 Phoebe then I'll suck you out|
 Who says (who says)|

 Listen, never doubt|
 Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)|
 Don't tell (don’t tell)|

 Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (it never grows cold)|
 Take thirty moonbeams|
 And a guitar|
 Phoebe first and suck you out|
 Little baby|
 No one better see|
 Caught your answer, be right out|
 Don’t speak (listen now)|
 Feed us (listen to me, dove)|
 Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)|
 It's all the same|
 Please smile angel|
 Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (it never grows cold)|
 Who says (who says)|
 I’ll never do it?|
 Listen, never doubt|
 Dawn your heart and shine the whole world (this whole world shines)|

 He learned how|
 How a pepper-tree (he reads)|
 Lights off (can they do)|
 And you know just a fact|
 Several things don’t fit|
 He’s a star|
 Once again it’s a fact|
 That now you’re|
 Accomplishing your goals (accomplish your goals)|
 Far more|
 He learned he|
 How a pepper-tree (he)|
 Silence (he flailed)|
 So glad he|
 Cares|
 So glad he|
 Slowly died but sometimes|
 Where your face goes|
 To be tough|
 Those are things in your life|
 That a man loves|
 Emotional fever (emotion fever)|
 Futile|
 He learned how|
 How a pepper-tree (fever)|
 So cruel (this fever)|
 I do not|
 So don’t test me|
 You never glance|
 The wind never blows (the wind never blows)|
 To see|
 He learned how|
 How a pepper-tree (fever)|
 So cruel (this fever)|
 The spirit of life found me now|
 The spirit of life found me now|

 Each day love found stone little|
 You see your singing is so vague|
 Each day love found stone little|
 Because you're fickle, oh that I find|
 So many stars take care of you|
 Let it out, we’re all inside your heart (let it out)|
 My love, my love|
 Love me, see no little|
 It seemed you looked like the sky was out|
 Our love will achieve no little|
 Because you're fickle, oh that I find|
 So many stars take care of you|
 Let it out, lover, we’re all inside your heart|
 Our love, our love|
 There’s no weather like ours|
 All the marvel (all the marvel)|
 Strange and lovely|
 It’s just a second, start to stop|
 It’s just a second, start to stop, stop|
 It’s just a second, start to stop|
 It’s just a second, start to stop, stop, stop|
 There’s no weather like ours|
 (We fall awake, be quiet)|
 I am not a normal woman|
 (We fall oh, with the devil)|
 Strange and lovely|
 So many stars take care of you|
 (These stars awake, be silent)|
 Full of love, love falling down|
 (These stars oh, with the devil)|
 Our love|
 There’s no weather like ours|
 (These stars awake, be silent)|
 Full of love, love falling down|
 (These stars oh, with the devil)|
 Strange and lovely day|

 Days, nervous|
 Long by the sea|
 Love, long-found love|
 Long, long ago|
 Love, love (happy)|
 Happy love (love)|
 Love, love (happy)|
 (Cute love, cute love)|
 Do they find love?|
 Do they find love?|
 Happy in bed|
 Happy in bed|
 Love, long-blown love|
 Damaged by the sun|
 Days spent, bed made|
 Queueing on the floor|
 Love, love (happy)|
 (Love, love)|
 Love, love (happy)|
 (Cute love, cute love)|
 Do they find love?|
 Do they find love?|
 Happy in bed|
 Happy in bed|
 Do they find love?|

 She lets memories go|
 What’s sad goes|
 So long ago|
 Tell me sweet nothings|

 I'm standing here|
 If I said “love,” you’d listen, my heart|
 Made love if you said|
 I thought he'd known love|
 Even but|
 He's so mean to her|
 Feonao hagaocolo dnula love|
 Eadu nasgha hedu lusogh gardea|
 I've been here|
 Herios mor hae asforpag|
 And I got what you’re here for|
 He gave me love|
 Haegi mi|
 He loved you, you know|
 He needed all, could he handle it|
 He had all he needed, all|
 He needed all, could he handle it|

 When the night time burrows|
 Through my heart, love|
 Now, now, now the knife|
 Through my heart|
 None of it (none of it)|
 Seems so bad (seems so bad)|
 With a wink from (wink from)|
 You dear (you dear)|
 None of it (none of it)|
 Seems so bad (seems so bad)|
 With a wink from (wink from)|
 You dear (you dear)|

 The next day’s (the next day’s)|
 Worth the wait (worth the wait)|
 But when you (when you)|
 Rush to join up all of the days|
 (Join up all of the days)|
 The next day’s (the next day’s)|
 Worth the wait (worth the wait)|

 Run to join up all of the dots|

 When the night time burrows|
 (Get a load the devil crawled through my own door)|
 Through my heart|
 (Shame on you and me)|
 Then hold on love|
 (Get a load the devil crawled right through my door)|
 On to my heart|
 (Shame on you and me)|
 Now, now, now, now the knife|
 (Get a load the devil crawled through my own door)|
 Through my heart|
 (Shame on you and me)|
 Now, now, now, no one knows|
 (Get a load the devil crawled right through my door)|
 About my heart|
 Beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else|
 You steam a lens stable eyes and glass|
 Not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news|
 Still being cried and|
 Laughed at from behind|
 "Don't fall behind, miss"|
 From first my turn's rules|
 Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and blues|
 Beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else|
 You steam a lens stable eyes and glass|
 Not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news|
 You'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night|
 We hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasy|
 (Still being cried and laughed at before)|
 Should I be sewn in hugged I can by not saying|
 (Still being cried and laughed at from light to blue)|
 And should I be hugged and tugged down through|
 This tiger's masque?|
 And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying|
 Your mind not saying|
 You'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night|
 (Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues)|
 We hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy|
 (Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues)|
 Should I be sung and unbroken by not saying|
 (Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues)|
 Hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for kicks|

 It don't have to be too good for you|
 Only up to the waist-deep end|
 Pitch the baby|
 She doesn't even know you're|
 Sleeping up as we see the sun|
 Hear the language|
 Come dress your baby|
 Only hope to not bust somethin’|
 Here I want to grow|
 And keep her warm|
 Man there must be somethin’|
 We've not found|
 I only want to love you|
 I only want to love you|
 It don't have to be too good for you|
 Only up to the waist-deep end|
 Pitch the baby|
 She doesn't even know you're|
 Sleeping up as we see her our sun|
 Hear the language|
 Come dress your baby|
 Only hope to not bust somethin’|
 Here I want to grow|
 And keep her warm|
 Man there must be somethin’|
 We've not found|
 I only want to love you|
 It don't have to be too good for me|
 I only want to love you|
 It don't have to be too good for me|
 I only want to love you|
 I wander through the streets|
 Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar|
 As everyone seems to notice|
 Everyone says you favor me, baby|
 I wander through the streets|
 Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar|
 As everyone seems to notice|
 Everyone says you favor me, baby|
 I wander through the streets|
 Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar|

 I'm seeming to be glad a lot|
 I'm happy again, calmer, calm in time|
 Expose your doubter, arm yourself with|
 Me and then ensure your rise|
 You're the match of Jericho|
 That will burn this whole madhouse down|
 And I'll throw open like the walnut safe|
 More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff is|
 You, yourself, and your father|
 Don't know, so much in your own ways|
 You're really both bone setters|
 Thank you for mending me babies|
 You're the match of Jericho|
 That will burn this whole madhouse down|
 And I'll throw open like a walnut safe|
 You would seem more like being from that same bottle of exquisite stuff|
 Is, you are the match of Jericho that will|
 Burn this whole madhouse down on the floor|
 Open like the walnut safe|
 You, yourself, and your father don't know|
 So much in your own ways|
 You're really both bone setters|
 Thank you for mending me babies|

 I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh|
 Oh, and you're a long shadow|
 I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh|
 I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh|
 Oh, and you're a long shadow|
 I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh|
 Smile and face your wife angry|
 His life don't despise what's in eyes|
 He skips so as the seasons|
 To come as a breeze has|
 Again, ahead|
 We'll rust, our nose dust|
 Ephemeral with peace and, oh its true|
 He can't comfort the brain|
 He was calm as he was|
 Again, ahead|
 And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light|
 Motions all in motion emotions all|
 Good morning love with someone I call in light|
 Motions all in motion emotions all|
 And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light|
 Motions all in motion emotions all|
~|
 Who'll ever win?|
 Gee you're so ephemeral|
 Go back for new|
 For new, they it failed|
 Singing on the famous street|
 I want to love, I've all the wrong glory|
 Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas|
 Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me|
 He's a hustler|
 It's a role, he'll never make suit|
 Hang on to this|
 Stay and spin and fail and fail|
 Who'll ever win?|
 Gee you're so ephemeral|
 Go back for new|
 For new, they it failed|
 Singing on the famous street|
 I want to love, I've all the wrong glory|
 Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas|
 Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me|
 This chill must itch in my soul|
 It's like any old playing card|
 Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas|
 It's why it's more brighter than the sun is to me|
 Come on, let's blast off|
 I'm dizzy so I go under the 'Big Dipper'|
 Confetti for a carnival|
 Confetti for a wedding|
 Singing on the famous street|
 I want to love, I've all the wrong glory|
 Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas|
 Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me|
 This chill must itch in my soul|
 It's like any old playing card|
 Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas|
 It's why it's more brighter than the sun is to me|
 Maybe then you will swear|
 This is hardly personal|
 I suspect I'm singing to you a tune|
 And still you find the beat|
 I'll sing it to you soon|

 You don't feel dammed between the sunrise and sunset|
 You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days|
 Race them or run on the turf|
 You could be raising money with your mama|
 You might be showing you're round and dressed up with kid|
 Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone|
 Men are so nice (reflection nous)|
 He pleases me fine|
 Men are so useful|
 Is a girl (so useful)|
 Reflection me|
 Men are so nice|
 Beautiful stars|

 “Beautiful” has got no weight as a means of love|
 One sounds, engulf the storm|
 And they had allure|
 They’re handsome dressed, and then dies reason|
 In the reign of sex, blown more than it’s pleased to be|
 He's a beauty, reflection nous|

 My dreams|
 Are erotic, sick, and must be addressed|
 They’re a young girl’s dreams|
 True, some do|
 Born and shoe'd, like the barely-lit stars|
 But I was just rouge|
 Like the scary hairs on our singing hoof|
 Like the scary hairs on our singing hooves|
 They couth|
 A fairy fool|
 Girl it’s you I can spoon inside me|
 When I’m set in my fate|
 A clean start, but I feel strong|
 That one bound, we all reached the ground|
 And then I’m empty-headed|
 See and saw|
 Bounce me back to you, will you?|
 See and saw|
 Bounce me back to you, will you?|
 Or will you?|
 My dreams|
 Are erotic, sick, and must be addressed|

 Under my shirt|
 Half to a muscling|
 The tainted bed|
 That we jump in|
 Go on|
 If my body|
 Puzzles to trick me|
 I lend it out to borrow|
 Or am I to find|
 My baby's cries|
 Laughing on our bed|
 I pretended I flew away|
 Especially when|
 Our rough angel|
 Unleashed the pain|
 If my body|
 Puzzles to trick me|
 I lend it out to borrow|
 Or am I to find|
 My baby's cries|
 Laughing on my bed|
 I pretended I flew away|
 Especially when|
 Our rough angel|
 Unleashed the pain|
 I feel perpetual|
 I feel perpetual|
 I feel perpetual|
 I feel, I feel perpetual|
 True blue and real|
 I feel, I feel|
 True blue and real|
 And I feel all of it|
 I pretended I flew away|
 Especially when|
 Our rough angel|
 Unleashed the pain|
 I feel perpetual|
 I feel perpetual|
 I feel perpetual|
 True and real|
~|
 Really far away|
 Though those choices can't be told|
 Naked and caught on the Île de la Cité|
 Oh holy pew is of eleventh century|
 Full of shame and a fearless decay|
 Formed into an angel|
 From some flower|
 Fabulous and dreamery|
 Flame on the crown in her influence|
 From out of the Bayeux|
 See him with hair pulled|
 Little pants suit and no waist|
 Through Paris we'd stroll|
 From out of the Bayeux|
 My destiny|
 Seventeen my mind was seized|
 Into the fold when you weren't feeling hated then|
 No boiling thirst|
 It was a focus of adjectives|
 Road, river and rail|
 So unblemished and natural|
 As mother's daughter|
 Today she'll follow road, river and rail|
 So unblemished and natural|
 Like mother's daughter|
 Today she'll follow road, river and rail|
 So unblemished and natural|
 Like mother's daughter|
 Today she'll follow road, river and rail|

 All broken and lost|
 Has got enemies|
 How the righteous speak|
 They warn all may lose|
 Close in to stay apart|
 A fire drinks ignitions|
 They turn infant’s breath, my|
 Milk in drafts to baby|
 And day from night take all…|
 All broken and lost|
 I’ve got enemies|
 How the righteous speak|
 They warn all may lose|
 Small features to have voice|
 A fire drinks ignitions|
 They turn infant’s breath, my|
 Love, hand out to baby|
 And day from night take all|
 Bad thoughts and soothe|
 All he was|
 Knows you|
 Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)|
 Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)|
 Limelight’s not the music, plain as this can be so (Pull tight)|
 All that I found, I have to go back, I need to choose (Tighter)|
 (Susan, let’s go together in the morning)|
 Rounder, pulled rounder|
 Pulled rounder, pulled rounder|
 Pulled round|
 Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)|
 Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)|
 Limelight’s not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)|
 All that I found, I have to go back, I need to choose (Tighter)|
 (Susan, let’s go together in the morning)|
 Rounder, pulled rounder|
 Pulled rounder, pulled rounder|
 Pulled round|
 (Pull)|
 (Tighter)|
 (Pull tight)|
 (Tighter)|
 Now vanity gone|
 Whose servants desert me|
 I’ve mostly been pressed|
 Now live down impression|
 Lead weight that seemed hopeless|
 The yoke that was young kids|
 I’m noosing the snares, I|
 Hung nets just to find you|
 All broken and lost|
 I’ve got enemies|
 How the righteous speak|
 They warn all may lose|
 Close in to stay apart|
 A fire drinks ignitions|
 They turn infant’s breath, like|
 Milk in drafts to baby|
 And day, yeah, from night take all|
 That I took, come sleep|
 All he made|
 Loves you|
 And day, open the air and|
 Your eyes, because doll|
 He made|
 Those stars I lost just to find you|
 Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)|
 Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)|
 Limelight’s not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)|
 All that I found, I have to go back, I need to choose (Tighter)|
 (Susan, let’s go together in the morning)|
 Rounder, pulled rounder|
 Pulled rounder, pulled rounder|

 My senses are addicted to, a discreet desire to|
 Observe such, Heal such|
 Behave such, it makes this hard for me|
 I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry|
 I can't grieve, so I won't grow, I won't heal 'til I let it go|

 Sorrow for letting someone else define you|
 Know who you are at every age|
 What impression am I making?|
 I see me as other people see me|
 There is no going back|
 I can't stop feeling now|
 I am not the same, I'm growing up again|
 I am not the same|
 I'm growing up again|
 There's no going back I can't stop feeling now|
 I had to fantasize|
 I was a princess, Mum and Dad were Queen and King|
 I ought to have what feeling?|
 I see me as other people see me|
 There is no going back|
 I can't stop feeling now|
 I am not the same, I'm growing up again|
 I am not the same|
 I'm growing up again|
 There's no going back I can't stop feeling now|
 Feeling now|
 There is no going back, and|
 I can't stop feeling now|
 I am not the same, I'm growing up again|
 I am not the same|
 I'm growing up again|
 There's no going back I can't stop feeling now|
 I had to fantasize|
 Just to survive|
 I was a famous artist|
 Everybody took me seriously|
 Even those who did|
 Never understood me|
 I had to fantasize|
 Just to survive|

 Are you safe? Are you my friend?|

 Are you safe? Are you my friend?|

 I balance, walk, and coordinate myself|
 I'm alive|

 This was a...|

 ...Boundaries|
 (Are you safe, are you my friend...)|
 And how long...|

 The man is an offender|
 He took my value|
 And I give back his shame|
 And I take back my power|
 My body is my own|
 My body is mine alone|
 And I deserve protection|
 'Cause I can create it from you|
 Is this what my body said?|
 "Use me, drain me|
 Overwhelm me"|
 Is this what my body said?|
 "Engulf me|
 I'm already dead"|
 I’m perfectly perfect|
 Crying shakes it off you|
 And I won’t poison love|
 It’s raveling a start with my body|
 My body is mine alone|
 My body is my own|
 And I deserve protection|
 'Cause I can create it from you|
 Is this what my body said?|
 "Use me, drain me|
 Overwhelm me"|
 Is this what my body said?|
 "Engulf me|
 I'm already dead"|
 Keep cutting myself on the edges of reality|
 Keep cutting myself on the edges of reality|
 Is this what my body said?|

 You become powerful|
 As you are accepting|
 And you can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|
 Commit to the work of growth|
 If you love what's energy, not chemistry|
 And you can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|
 You can, you can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|
 You can, you can work through the pain|
 And come to beautiful peace|
 It's frightening (frightening)|
 Exciting (exciting)|
 Something shakes up my whole understanding|
 My truth (truth)|
 Is my birthright (right)|
 I enthuse, I'm confused to say I'm not angry|
 (Confusing, confusing)|
 You can, you can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|
 You can, you can work through the pain|
 And come to beautiful peace|
 I remember (remember)|
 My secret (secret)|
 I write it down and then I tell it|
 (I write it down, and then I tell it)|
 There's not (there's not)|
 One thing (one thing)|
 Outside of myself|
 (Outside of myself)|
 That can save me|
 (That can save me, that can save me)|
 You can, you can, you can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|
 You can work through the pain|
 And come home to peace|
 You can work through the pain|
 Or enjoy the pleasure|

 And hug a distant sister when I wanna hug-a you|
 You have a natural right to be born and to become|
 Having a small niece becomes acceptable to me|
 I feel angry that I lost you, imagine being there|
 Where do baby leaves go when they die|
 Or why? I do not know|
 God is a feeling of loving yourself|
 And you’re precious to me, don’t you know|
 Stretch out, wrap around|
 Loving myself with all my might|
 Where do baby leaves go when they die|
 Or why? I do not know|
 God is a feeling of loving yourself|
 And you’re precious to me, don’t you know|
 Take a look inside to see|
 See how I am dreaming|
 A message softly says to me|
 Tells me I like it|
 Who really wishes that you couldn’t move on?|
 Think you'll not be home tonight|
~|
 My dream is here with us|
 My tears are run away|
 Our goal, goal collapsed|
 Energy, unblossomed longing|
 Vicious dreams and memories|
 Shame casts my face|
 Shame casts my face|
 Star isn't star|
 A nova blaze|
 Safe at last|
 Seeing my forces in order|
 Safe, whole, and that is why|
 I want to be just what I am|
 Still more treasure|
 Still more gifts|
 The soul-fire's creative thirst|
 Until we grow up|
 It won't free you|
 I'm going for the key|
 Un(un un)consciousness don't look awake|
 Not my keeper, I'm not a slave|
 Not my devil, not asleep|
 My truth's not even|
 Even half it was|
 Safe at last|
 Seeing my thoughts in order|
 Safe at last|
 Safe at last|
 Seeing my thoughts in order|
 Safe, whole, and that is why|
 I want to be just what I am|
 Safe at last|
 Seeing my thoughts in order|
 Safe, whole, and that is why|
 I want to be just what I am|

 I'm glad you are a girl|
 I'm pleased to know you|
 I like you for you|
 I'm happy you're growing up|
 Rejection won't lose me|
 Destroy the objective, but still survive|
 You are angry and that's okay|
 Forgetful or pretending|
 Tired, ill, or angry, or cold|
 More assured of what to do|
 But I do care for you (What a beautiful gift for me)|
 Rejection won't lose me|
 Destroy the objective, but still survive|
 You are angry and that's okay, yes|
 I am not afraid of your anger|
 What do you need? What do you want?|
 I love you and I know that you can figure it out|
 Rejection won't lose me|
 Destroy the objective, but still survive|
 You are angry and that's okay, yes|
 I am not afraid of your anger|
 What do you need? What do you want?|
 I love you and I know that you can figure it out|
 Rejection won't lose me|
 Destroy the objective, but still survive|
 You are angry and that's okay, yes|
 I am not afraid of your anger|
 What do you need? What do you want?|
 I love you and I know that you can figure it out|

 It’s hard to judge, I get used to it|
 A living, sole survivor|
 Thought I’d be more sensitive|
 A living, sole survivor|
 Had to find a job|
 Had to find a job|
 Those could be my clothes|
 What you have always been|
 You were an outlaw suddenly|
 Once I find a job|
 Once I find a job|
 Thought I’d found a seat to preach|
 Moving, less surviving|
 Product in a media court|
 Moving, less surviving|
 Had to find a job|
 Once I find a job|
 I should arrive there|
 Where you have always been|
 You were an outlaw suddenly|
 Once I find a job|
 Once I find a job|
 Had to find a job|
 Once I find a job|
 Those could be my clothes|
 What you have always been|
 You were an outlaw suddenly|
 Once you find a job|
 You never earn enough|
 And you’re speaking your heart|
 You saw the laddie|
 Call a memory|
 Don’t accept them for beauty|
 You didn’t matter|
 He’s just a laddie|
 Call a memory|
 Don’t accept them for beauty|
 You shook so hard|
 You saw the laddie|
 Call a memory|
 Don’t accept them for beauty|
 You, who to call|
 You saw the laddie|
 Part of him was living proof|
 A living, sole survivor|
 Thought I’d be more sensitive|
 A living, sole survivor|
 Such a great fuss|
 Living for|
 Living for|
 A something|
 A job|
~|
 I’m at a loss|
 Don’t know what to do|
 Feel like I want him less now|
 Could he just hold me?|
 Don’t feel safe enough to|
 Surrender into sensation|
 Afraid but look what happens when|
 I don’t risk losing you|
 There’s no guarantees|
 I need to know|
 If the response is cold|
 I’m in the wrong place|
 Is it like a dream?|
 Or does it seem grounded and real?|
 Is it like a dream?|
 Or does it seem grounded and real?|
 I feel a connection|
 A deep connection|
 But it’s not reflected|
 In time spent together|
 It’s reflected psychically|
 Emotionally|
 Is it like a dream?|
 Or does it seem grounded and real?|
 Is it like a dream?|
 Or does it seem grounded and real?|
 This mountain of pleasure|
 I want to get lost in it|
 Sleep like a baby|
 Still close|
 Still close|
 Until I don’t know where you end|
 Or I begin|
 Until I just carry it in me|
 I wanna get lost|
 Wanna get lost|
 Wanna get lost|
 Lost in it|
 We’re still close|
 Still close|
~|
 It's an old game, my love|
 When you can't have me, you want me|
 Because you know that you're not risking anything|
 Intimacy is when we're in the same place|
 At the same time|
 Dealing honestly with how we feel|
 And who we really are|
 That's what grown-ups do|
 That is mature thinking|
 Well I'm still a junkie for it|
 It takes me out of my aloneness|
 But this relationship cannot sustain itself|
 Intimacy is when we're in the same place|
 At the same time|
 Dealing honestly with how we feel|
 And who we really are|
 That's what grown-ups do|
 That is mature thinking|
 I just have to know how to be in the process|
 Of creating things in a better way|
 And it hurts but it's a lie that I can't handle it|
 I still have a world of me-ness to fulfill|
 I still have a life, and it's a rich one even with mourning|
 Even with grief and sadness|
 I still care about this planet|
 I am still connected to nature|
 And to my dreams for myself|
 I have my friends, my family|
 I have myself|
 I still have me|
~|
 I have to swallow my fear|
 Life, it, it just seems right, now|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 And when I had you|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 I didn’t always want you, baby|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 I’d cry myself out|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 But you’d survive to amaze me|
 Still, still (still, still)|
 With a birdlike claw|
 (And seize them in two claws)|
 Caw, caw (caw, caw)|
 Calling to yourself|
 (Calling to find more)|
 Love, heart (then, heart)|
 Then you got me|
 (And you got part of me)|
 No one (heart, love)|
 It was a flawless kind of crime|
 (Now feel that muscle)|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 And when I had you|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 I didn’t always want you, baby|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 I’d cry myself out|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 Ooh la la la la la|
 But you’d survive to amaze me|
~|
 Rilkean heart I looked for you|
 To give me transcendent experiences|
 To transport me out of self and aloneness|
 And alienation into a sense of|
 One-ness and connection ecstatic and magical|
 I became a junkie for it|
 I came looking for the next high|
 And I'm sorry I've been|
 Putting the search on the wrong place|
 I understand that you're confused|
 Feeling overwhelmed|
 Well that's a feeling state from then|
 The reality|
 With cleaning up my emotion of life|
 And I'm getting in touch with myself|
 I'm beginning to ground myself|
 In my own sense of being as an entity|
 One entity on the planet|
 Becoming truly self-reliant and become connected|
 With something beyond me|
 That is where I have to go|
 I'm so sorry I've been|
 Putting the search on the wrong place|
 You're lost and don't know what to do|
 But that's not all of you|
 That's your reality today|
 And that is all okay|
 I understand that you're confused|
 Feeling overwhelmed|
 Well that's a feeling state from then|
 The reality|
 You're lost and don't know what to do|
 But it's not all of you|
 That's the reality today|
 And now it's all okay|
 I understand that you're confused (Rilkean heart)|
 Feeling overwhelmed|
 Well that's a feeling state from then|
 The reality|

 No way|
 It really comes to pass|
 It's the sure movement|
 She's happy being there|
 For an age|
 Before the stars that beat|
 Now there's no more|
 Dreamers|
 For I am|
 I am happy|
 Oh, shine|
 On|
 In our flowered|
 Air|
 Our walls|
 Crumbled in...|
 Fear of some|
 Whom we know|
 These are feelings of|
 Suffering|
 Tell me now|
 This is true love|
 My soul's on fire|
 Floating slowly...|
 Golden days|
 The really olden days|
 I felt sheltered in|
 And thank you|
 Treasure|
 Was spread|
 Trembling in|
 Safe heart|
 Be younger than|
 My young self|
 Where were|
 We were|
 Loving|
 My guidance|
 Feeling of|
 Flying|
 Fear of some|
 Whom we know|
 These are feelings|
 Of suffering|
 Tell me now|
 This is true love|
 My soul's on fire|
 Floating slowly|
 I am charmed|
 I am charmed|
 I am charmed|
 I am charmed|

 The lips, the heart|
 Feel the fire|
 Feel the soul here|
 Feel the fire|
 The heart, the soul|
 Illuminated|
 (The lips, the heart)|
 There’s a fire|
 (There’s a flame, burn in my name)|
 Feel it ache now|
 So handsome for her|
 (The heart, the soul)|
 Can begin (can begin)|
 (And better than me)|
 Feel the fire|
 (The lips, the heart)|
 Feel the fire|
 (There’s a flame, burn in my name)|
 Feel the fire|
 (The heart, the soul)|
 Can begin (can begin)|
 (And better than me)|
 The lips, the heart|
 The heart, the soul|
 Conscious, chosen traps (illuminated)|
 Treasure hiding|
 Scared, a sense of steel|
 Love brought, soon I was drowning|
 Deep, without light|
 Down, down and full of tears|
 Collective interests start|
 Fire hairs had no|
 Belly focus|
 Light the discards|
 Purified love, go on|
 Constancy|
 Purifies mistakes|
 And with substance|
 Reproduces fire|
 Laced with a fire|
 Your heart|
 Illuminated|
 The lips, the heart|
 Feel the fire|
 Feel the fire|
 The heart, the soul|
 Illuminated, illuminated|

 Let’s fight gracefully|
 A love as big as a risk fills you up|
 And you can’t put it down|
 The breath of God in my mouth|
 A love I can taste, got kissing paste|
 You know our paths have crossed before|
 Clove of saliva|
 Heated through your love|
 I can’t stop hungering for the new yes|
 I forgot the use|
 My head fell out of the sky and it crashed into my palms|
 Jesus, God, Valentine|
 Love, on the tip of it|
 You looked nervous|
 Like I wanted sweet sex|
 Some seek it|
 You are a woman just as you are a man|
 Deep in hunger|
 It’s a magic love|
 Like a flash-flood of heat|
 I was choking on the blood|
 Which camouflaged a flock of soul|
 Whose misty fire amuses so|
 Kneeling by the hand|
 Which was promising a way|
 It was poor essence, an untruth|
 Not in half-part it’s yourself|
 I stick my heels in bloody well|
 And send Lucifer into Hell|
 Love, on the tip of it|
 You looked nervous|
 Like I wanted sweet sex|
 Some seek it|
 You are a woman just as you are a man|
 Love, on the tip of it|
 You looked nervous|
 Like I wanted sweet sex|
 Some seek it|
 You are a woman just as you are a man|
 Love, on the tip of it|
 You looked nervous|
 Like I wanted sweet sex|
 Some seek it|
 You are a woman just as you are a man|
~|
 Bliss for me|
 Is soft in the bed of sweet dreams|
 You’re inside some soft world|
 Sing, I'll do anything|
 But sorrow covers me|
 —Fall all over me|
 Sublime light, with tingles|
 Sing, and you touch me|
 With sad lust revealing sweet dreams|
 Your song light will touch me|
 Sing nice body, passing over me (through and over me)|
 So find me, come answer me (come answer me)|
 We find it deep, it's my minute, friend|
 Not long before the wisps of starlight (wisps of starlight)|
 Meet the sunrise through the shining (through the shining)|
 Come out to see me|
 Come back to me|
 To sunlight (to the sunlight)|
 Put the sun on|
 Come back now, put the sunlight on (oh)|
 We sleep and dream, it's my minute, friend|
 Come feel the deep|
 It's love in a floodlamp|
 Come feel the deep|
 It's love in a flood|
 Ah, ah|
 Oh, oh|
 Sing and touch light|
 You satisfy me|
 The same light will touch you|
 Sing as you know me|
 And pass it over me (give it to me)|
 Come find me|
 Come back to me|
~|
 Though the soul must convey|
 Some more tears to delete|
 He is there to your death|
 Burning as alcohol|
 Must so live, flower of love|
 So's psyche in staged|
 Dialectics|
 Sneaking out, suitcase shown|
 Lover must have a man|
 To quiz of making man|
 This joy, pain on her heart|
 Smooth things frame till sugared|
 Midnight he'll sing blue|
 Cuz he's silly|
 What woman can sing|
 Without loving the primitive heart|
 Heart, heart|
 Loving the primitive heart|
 Strain, strain|
 Clouding yourself by seeing strain|
